# Change_making

## Tested using Python 3.6.3

### Simply run as : 
```console
  python3 test_rendu_simple.py
  python3 rendy_simple.py
```
                
### Alternatively :
```python
  import rendu_simple
  change = rendu_simple.optimalChange(123)
  print(change)
```


#### Note : You may be wondering why 'simple', well, a more complex version was also made, working for arbitrary denomination lists, floating point values and has dynamic attribute access (i.e. coin2 still works, despite not being hardcoded). It was not uploaded due to 'high' complexity compared to what was asked - and did not yet received the lastest modifications (mostly cosmetic).
